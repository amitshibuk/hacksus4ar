# _HackS'US AR_

An AR Card I made for [HackS'US EDITION IV](https://api.unstop.com/hackathons/hacksus-edition-iv-rajagiri-school-of-engineering-and-technology-rset-kerala-1399381), a 36-Hour long national level hackathon with over 300 participants, using Blender and AR.js. I used a barcode marker for this project. 

Hosted on [Netilify](https://hacksusar.netlify.app/)
